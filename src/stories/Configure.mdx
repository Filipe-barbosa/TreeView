    # TreeView
  The TreeView is a React component that provides an interactive tree view with checkboxes and expandability features. It is designed to present hierarchical data clearly and enable user interaction.
  The component operates based on a recursive graph system, crafted to optimize processing costs during search and state management. This approach focuses on efficiency when dealing with higher-level elements compared to lower-level ones in the tree hierarchy. The recursive process provides a dynamic and effective structure, simplifying not only the handling of the check state of elements but also managing downstream changes resulting from changes in higher-level nodes.
  In practical terms, this means that the check state of a high-level element in a branch consequently influences changes in subordinate elements. Similarly, changes in lower-level elements also impact higher-level elements. This bidirectional approach to state management allows for efficient synchronization between different levels of the tree, providing a more cohesive and intuitive user experience.
  This approach also results in a more linear processing cost.

          The component can be collapsed when the node sequence has more than one level, offering the possibility of expansion or contraction. It is important to highlight that the rendering of the component is responsible for managing this collapse and display capability of lower-level nodes.
          The component's checkbox has three distinct states: "Checked," "Partial," and "none." The transition between the "Checked" and "none" states results from the direct actions of the user when checking or unchecking the checkbox. The "Partial" state, indicated by the dash icon, is the result of not all lower-level nodes being checked.
          Clicking on a node at the base of the sequence, i.e., at the lowest level, changes the states of all "parent" nodes. However, nodes at the same level remain unchanged. This approach allows for selective manipulation of states, ensuring that user interaction is precise and adapted to the hierarchical structure of the tree.
          The status control logic is applied after the user's initial interaction with the component. Upon rendering, it simply displays the statuses received as parameters. Starting from the first interaction, it begins to control them based on the proposed business rule.

            children: [
              {
                id: '2',
                label: '<h3>First Children</h3>',
                status: 'none',
                loading: true,
                children: [
                  {
                    id: '3',
                    label: '<p>First GrandChildren</p>',
                    status: 'none',
                    children: [],
                  },
                ],
              },
              { id: '4', label: 'Second Children',  status: 'none', children: [] },
            ],
          },
        ];
        ```
      The component expects an array of objects with properties such as "id" of type string, "status" of type string, and "label" that can be of type ReactElement, as it supports HTML tags. Additionally, it has a "children" property, which is itself an array of objects with the same aforementioned properties.
      In the following examples, the usability of the component will be explained, including its variations.
